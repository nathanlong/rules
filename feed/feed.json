      "title": "Solitaire Gin Rummy",
      "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>Solitaire Gin Rummy is a solitaire card game that can be played anywhere because you hold all the cards in your hands. It was described in Games Magazine, June 1998. I pulled these rules off a forum from BoardGameGeek (link now lost to time). This game is currently under review on whether it's good enough to remain in rotation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rules are designed to be as close to Gin Rummy as possible. Your opponent is the joker. Your goal is to &quot;go gin&quot; before the joker appears.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Place one joker in the deck, and remove the other joker.</li>\n<li>Shuffle the deck thoroughly. Deal yourself ten cards. Hold them in one hand, and either set the rest of the deck, face down, beside you, or hold it face down in your other hand. (This is easier to do if you use miniature cards.)</li>\n<li>If the joker appears in your hand, you can either say you lost that hand, or you can just reshuffle and start over.</li>\n<li>Draw the top card from the deck and put it in your hand. Discard one card from your hand, so that you still have ten cards in your hand.</li>\n<li>Place the discarded card on the bottom of the deck.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal is to form &quot;melds&quot; in your hand. A meld is a set of three or more cards that are either all the same kind (eg. all threes) or form a numerical sequence all in the same suit (a straight flush in poker.) If all the cards in your hand are in melds, you have &quot;gin&quot; and have won the hand. If the joker appears before you go gin, you lose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"optional-scoring-and-knocking\" tabindex=\"-1\">Optional scoring and knocking <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/solitaire-gin-rummy/#optional-scoring-and-knocking\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you would like to make the game more like real gin rummy, you can keep score for several hands. The first player (you or the joker) to get 100 points wins the game.</p>\n<p>If you have a gin hand, turn over the cards in the deck one at a time until the joker appears. The number of cards you turn over is your score.</p>\n<p>If the joker appears before you have a gin hand, add up the values of cards you have in your hand that are not in melds, counting number cards at face value and court cards as ten. The total is the joker's score.</p>\n<p>If your hand contains ten or fewer points in unmelded cards, you may &quot;knock&quot;. Stop play and figure the two scores as described above. The one with the higher score recieves the difference in scores. For example, suppose you knock when you have a three and a five unmelded in your hand. Your hand counts eight points for the joker. You count the cards in the deck until the joker appears, and there are ten cards, which counts as ten points for you. Instead of giving ten points to you and eight to the joker, just give yourself two points, (ten minus eight.) If you scored and the joker scored ten, you would give the joker two points.</p>\n<p>If you knock and the joker turns out to have the higher score (that is, there are more points in unmelded cards than there are cards above the joker in the deck), the joker receives 25 bonus points for &quot;undercutting the knock.&quot; If you get gin while playing with this rule, you recieve 25 bonus points.</p>\n<p>I usually don't keep score; it's more fun for me just to play a quick hand. But because there's so much chance involved in where the joker will be, keeping score over several games would give you a better idea of how well you're playing in general. You could have a goal of improving your average over time.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>The annual pheasant shoot at Leverstoke Hall is always eagerly anticipated and forms the principal topic of speculation at September soirées across four counties. This year promises to be no exception, with a large party of the region's most prominent landowners shortly to descend upon those hallowed woods for a weekend of impeccable social graces and bloody slaughter.</p>\n<p>You, an ambitious young adventurer, are among those favoured few by simple expedient of a forged letter of introduction. And while the gentry pass the weekend in depriving the local copses of their birdlife, you plan to pass the time seducing four of their most delectable young wives, and relieving them of their jewels.</p>\n<p>For you are such an attractive and nimble young person that success is assured, if only you can contrive some time alone with each of them. This won't be easy, under the watchful eyes of husbands and associated private secretaries.</p>\n<p>But if it were easy then there would be no fun in it, would there?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shooting Party is a solitaire card game to pass the time between pheasant drives. It requires only a standard deck of cards and plays in approximately 10 minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aim\" tabindex=\"-1\">Aim <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/shooting-party/#aim\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>To contrive to be alone with each of four young ladies in turn, by removing all other cards from your hand on four separate occasions.

The remaining 33 cards represent the guests with whom you may interact.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The queens represent the four young ladies that you aim to distract.</li>\n<li>The aces represent their jewels (♥️ blood ruby, ♦️ diamond tiara, ♣️ black pearls, ♠️ emerald brooch).</li>\n<li>The kings are their husbands and the jacks are the husbands' private secretaries.</li>\n<li>The included joker is the butler.</li>\n<li>The remaining cards (ranks 2 to 5) represent other, less attractive guests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: If so inclined, the game can be played the same with genders reversed. Simply swap the roles of kings and queens and substitute &quot;wives&quot; for &quot;husbands&quot;, &quot;pocketbooks&quot; for &quot;jewels&quot;, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gameplay\" tabindex=\"-1\">Gameplay <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/shooting-party/#gameplay\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shuffle the deck and place it face down as the draw pile</strong>.**</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whenever you have five or fewer cards in your hand you may draw two more to add to your hand. This represents a pair of guests entering the room.</li>\n<li>Whenever you draw an ace, place it face up on the table above the draw and discard piles and immediately draw another card to replace it in your hand. The displayed aces indicate which ladies are wearing their jewels at the time.</li>\n<li>If the draw pile is exhausted, retain your hand, but thoroughly shuffle together the discards with any unscored aces to create a new draw pile. Reshuffling may only be performed twice in the course of the game.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Draw <ins>four</ins> cards to form your <strong>hand.</strong> This represents the guests currently occupying the same room as you.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discard from your hand according to the rules of etiquette overleaf. Discarding represents people leaving the room in response to your clever quip or verbal manipulation.</li>\n<li>At any time you may leave the room yourself by discarding your entire hand and drawing a new hand of four cards.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If you succeed in reducing your hand to a single queen then you can distract her and may lay her on the <strong>score pile</strong>. She will retire to her room with a headache for the rest of the weekend and will not appear again in the game.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the ace of the same suit as this queen is currently displayed on the table then you may add it to the score pile as well, indicating that you successfully pocketed her jewels during the distraction.</li>\n<li>Since your hand is now empty, draw a new hand of four cards.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"etiquette\" tabindex=\"-1\">Etiquette <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/shooting-party/#etiquette\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The rules of etiquette must be observed at all times. If, on occasion, more than one might apply, then they should be obeyed in the following order of precedence.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>One: Groups of more than seven are not conducive to agreeable discourse.</dt>\n<dd>You may draw a pair of cards only if you have five or fewer cards in your hand. Both cards must be drawn before resolving their effects.</dd>\n<dt>Two: Husbands should guard their young wives from unseemly temptations by removing them from the company of attractive young men. Constant vigilance is required; husbands should not allow themselves to be distracted by business.</dt>\n<dd>If you hold a <strong>queen and king of the same suit</strong> you must immediately <strong>discard</strong> them both, unless you also hold the <strong>jack</strong> of that suit, in which case you may discard the <strong>king and jack</strong> instead.</dd>\n<dt>Three: Ladies appear to best advantage when admirers are not distracted by the presence of other ladies.</dt>\n<dd>You may never hold more than <strong>one queen</strong> in your hand; the one that has been there the longest must be <strong>discarded</strong> immediately. If you draw two together then the one that was topmost in the draw pile must be discarded.</dd>\n<dt>Four: Private secretaries are generally over-inquisitive young men whose prying may uncover truths which you would prefer to remain hidden.</dt>\n<dd>If you ever hold <strong>two or more jack</strong>s you must immediately discard your whole hand (i.e. leave the room) and draw another four cards.</dd>\n<dt>Five: Gentlemen and ladies are most comfortable conversing with others of similar social standing on topics of mutual interest.</dt>\n<dd>You may discard exactly two cards of the same suit, for example: 2♥︎ + 3♥︎, or J♦︎ + 4♦︎, or K♣︎ + 5♣︎.</dd>\n<dd>Or any two or more cards of the same rank, for example: 4♣︎ + 4♠︎, or K♦︎ + K♠︎, or 2♥︎ + 2♣︎ + 2♠︎</dd>\n<dt>Six; A sympathetic butler can be a powerful ally; often a juicy tipoff for the local greyhound races will prove sufficient to secure his loyalty.</dt>\n<dd>The <strong>joker</strong> may be discarded to <strong>retrieve one card from the discard pile</strong>, or one ace from the draw pile (place the ace face up as usual and shuffle the draw pile).</dd>\n<dd>Alternatively the joker may simply be discarded on its own, without needing to be paired with another card.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2 id=\"game-end\" tabindex=\"-1\">Game End <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/shooting-party/#game-end\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The game ends when the draw pile is exhausted for the third time, or all of the queens are in the score pile.</p>\n<p>Count up the scored cards (queens and aces). Since the jewels can only be taken during a distraction, you should never have more aces than queens in the score pile. The number of scored cards indicates your social status, from impecunious boor to filthy scoundrel:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Number of jewels (aces)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Number of distractions (queens)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">0 = impecunious</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">0 = boor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">1 = common</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">1 = cad</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">2 = bourgeois</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">2 = rake</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">3 = oofy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">3 = bounder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">4 = filthy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">4 = scoundrel</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The Shooting Party © John Kean, 2016</p>\n<p>Rules version: 20160714</p>\n<p><em>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</em></p>\n",

The goal is to try to get rid of as many dominoes as possible and have the lowest score based on the dominoes remaining before your opponents can do the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"starting-off-rounds\" tabindex=\"-1\">Starting off Rounds <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/chickenfoot/#starting-off-rounds\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Each player draws a set of dominoes from a shuffled face down the pile to create their “hand”, making sure the domino values are concealed from their opponents. The number of dominoes each player draws varies with the number of players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 players draw 21 dominoes each</li>\n<li>3 players draw 14 dominoes each</li>\n<li>4 players draw 11 dominoes each</li>\n<li>5 players draw 8 dominoes each</li>\n<li>6 players draw 7 dominoes each</li>\n<li>7 players draw 6 dominoes each</li>\n<li>8 players draw 5 dominoes each</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The leftover dominoes are placed on the side and referred to as the “chicken yard.”</p>\n<p>Chicken foot establishes a round with a starting “double” (a tile with the same amount of pips or the same number on each end) placed in the centerpiece. For a double 9 set, you begin the first round with the double 9 domino.</p>\n<p>[diagram: Hub and Double 9]</p>\n<p>The subsequent rounds begin with the next highest double, double 8, and the following round double 7, all the way to double 0 for a total of ten rounds. If no one has the required starting double then each player simultaneously draws a domino from the chicken yard until it is found and a starting player is determined.</p>\n<p>Going clockwise, the next player must play a domino from their hand off the starting double. This domino must have a matching end to the starting double. If they do not have one, they draw a domino from the chicken yard and play that if possible. If not, the player calls “Pass” and the turn moves to the next player. The following player repeats the process of trying to play off the starting double and this continues until all sides of the centerpiece are filled.</p>\n<p>Optionally, one can also play with just six sides or four sides filled and also without the centerpiece. This is merely a matter of preference.</p>\n<p>[diagram: Showing alternate methods of Hub and Double 9]</p>\n<h2 id=\"subsequent-turns\" tabindex=\"-1\">Subsequent Turns <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/chickenfoot/#subsequent-turns\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After all the sides are played off the starting double, plays can continue off any exposed end domino as long as the ends match.</p>\n<p>[diagram: Matching Dominoes end to end]</p>\n<p>If the player is unable to add a domino, then the player must draw a domino from the chicken yard and play that domino immediately if he is able to.

The player then calls “Chickie” plus the numbers played. For example, if a double 5 was played, the player would call “Chickie Fives.” The next three plays must be made off that double, creating an arrangement that resembles a chicken foot.</p>\n<p>[diagram: showing completed chicken foot]</p>\n<p>If the player is unable to play on that double, he must draw from the chicken yard and play that domino if possible or else pass.

Or perhaps the rats and giraffes of Lamarck’s colorful imagination.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"to-begin:\" tabindex=\"-1\">To Begin: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/lamarckian-poker/#to-begin:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Shuffle the deck, and deal each player a starting hand of four cards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"on-each-turn:\" tabindex=\"-1\">On Each Turn: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/lamarckian-poker/#on-each-turn:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Deal four cards face up in the center of the table. These cards are called the “pool.” Each player plays one card from his hand face down on the table. This card is called the “mark.” When all the marks are down, reveal them. They will then be played one at a time, in descending order. Suit determines the order between cards of the same rank, with clubs at the bottom, then diamonds, hearts, and spades.</p>\n<p>When played, each mark can capture cards from the pool. When you play a mark, you pick up all the cards which match it, either by suit or by rank. The mark itself falls into the pool. For example, if a Queen of spades is your play, you will pick up all the spades, and all the Queens, and then put the Queen of spades into the pool.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"another-example:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Another Example: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/lamarckian-poker/#another-example:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>On the first round of a three-player game, the following cards are dealt into the pool: A♥, Q♣, 9♠, 5♥. Each player plays a mark face down, and then the cards are revealed to be the A♠, 10♣, and 9♥. The marks are now played from highest to lowest, so the A♠ goes first, capturing the A♥ and the 9♠, and then falling in. The new pool contains the A♠, Q♣, and 5♥. Then, the 10♣ takes the Q♣, and falls into the pool. Last, the 9♥ takes the 5♥, and falls in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the last mark is played, discard whatever is left in the pool, and deal four new cards into the pool, starting a new round.</p>\n<p>Play continues until the deck is empty. After the last round, there is a showdown, and the player with the best poker hand wins.</p>\n<p>It’s possible, especially with a large number of players, for people’s hands to empty. This is just a result of natural selection. If your hand is ever empty at the end of a turn, you go extinct and are out of the game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"strategy:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Strategy: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/lamarckian-poker/#strategy:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>You don’t want to run out of cards, so in the early stages of the game you must try to pick up more cards than you play, regardless of how well they build your poker hand. At some point you will have to start tuning your hand with more precise plays, but only when you no longer run the risk of running out of cards.

In each column, the cards are of the same suit, and the cards must be decreasing in value (K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A) but may skip values. To play a card to the table it must be either added to the bottom of a column of the same suit containing only cards of a higher value, or placed to start a new column.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gameplay\" tabindex=\"-1\">Gameplay <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/bogey/#gameplay\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The game starts with an empty board. Play alternates between you and the bogie, starting with you.</p>\n<p>On your turn you first draw enough cards to bring your hand to five cards. For each card in your hand you must decide whether to play it to the table, discard it, or to hold on to it for the next turn.</p>\n<p>The bogey then takes his turn. He plays the next card in the deck either adding to an existing column or starting a new one. You may choose where the card is played. If it cannot be played legally the game is lost. Remember there is a limit of twelve columns.</p>\n<p>You can also choose to pass your turn, letting the bogey play multiple times in a row, in effect choosing to 'hold on' to all your cards (not discarding or playing any of them).</p>\n<p>When the deck has run out the discards are shuffled and become the deck.</p>\n<p><strong>A more difficult variant</strong>: A more difficult version of the game is to change the hand size to 4 (instead of 5). This means the bogey plays cards a higher proportion of the time.</p>\n<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />\n//Designer: Katharine Turner//<br />\n//Year: 2016//<br />\n//[[BGG Entry|https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/202723/bogey]]//<br />\n&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>\n",

That player has two options: he can surrender and lose the fight, or he can play a card of higher rank than the card you played. (Suit doesn’t matter.)</p>\n<p>If your opponent plays a higher card, you may respond with an even higher card, or you may surrender. This continues until one player gives up, or can’t play a higher card.</p>\n<p>The winner of the fight draws a random card from the loser’s hand. That card goes into the winner’s “board,” which is a faceup collection of cards on the table in front of him.</p>\n<p>Board cards aren’t part of your hand. You can’t fight with them, discard them, or lose them in fights. They will help you in the showdown.</p>\n<p>After the fight, all cards which were played in the fight get sorted into the appropriate lifeboats. (Think of it as other pirates picking up all the stuff you threw at each other.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"important-restriction:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Important Restriction: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/abandon-ship/#important-restriction:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h4>\n<p>You cannot play the last card in your hand, unless that card is a King. This rule ensures that the winner will always be able to draw a card from the loser’s hand.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pointless-restriction:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Pointless Restriction: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/abandon-ship/#pointless-restriction:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h4>\n<p>You can’t challenge a player who is holding no cards. You’d have nothing to draw from him, and you can achieve the same result by simply discarding a card.</p>\n<pre><code>\n            `..                   `\n         `--. `:.               --`--`\n       .--      .-            .:`    .-.\n    .--`         `: Discard  -.      ` `--`\n   :.      ♣︎     `-.

At this point, it’s time for each player to bribe his way into a lifeboat, in the phase called the “showdown.”</p>\n<p>Each player plays one card from his hand, face down. This card is called the Key Card, and it is a declaration of which lifeboat you’re running to. This means that you must be lucky enough to hold a card matching the lifeboat you want. If your hand is empty, which is rare, you will go down with the ship and score no points for the round. Once everyone has played a Key Card, reveal all the cards in everyone’s hand.</p>\n<p>If everyone ran for a different lifeboat, there’s no contest. Each player gets the point value of the cards in that lifeboat. You do not score the cards in your hand, your Key Card, or your board.</p>\n<p>If more than one person went for the same lifeboat, then only one player will get in. The points in the lifeboat will go to the player who is holding more points in the matching suit, including his hand, his board, and his Key Card. If there is a tie, it is broken in favor of the player who has the single highest card in that suit. As above, you score only the points in the lifeboat.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"scoring-example:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Scoring Example: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/abandon-ship/#scoring-example:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It’s the showdown in a four-player game. Player 1 plays a Spade, Players 2 and 3 play Hearts, and Player 4 plays nothing because his hand is empty. Player 1 gets the points in the Spade lifeboat, and Player 4 gets nothing.</p>\n<p>Players 2 and 3 have both gone for the Hearts lifeboat, so they must compete to get in. Compare all the Hearts they hold: Player 2 has the 6h on his board, played the Qh as his Key, and holds no other Hearts. Player 3 played the 2h as his Key, and held only the 3h and the 7h in his hand. Player 2 takes the lifeboat, with 18 total points of Hearts vs. Player 3’s 12 points. Player 3 scores nothing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"winning:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Winning: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/abandon-ship/#winning:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Play to 200 points. If two players break 200 on the same round, the player with the highest score wins. If two players are tied for the high score, they must engage in the embarrassing Caribbean Plank Walk tied together with a ten-foot rope and clenching knives in their teeth.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"strategy:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Strategy: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/posts/abandon-ship/#strategy:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The cards that you discard and play in fights are crucial choices. Every card that you play in this manner will wind up in a lifeboat. On the other hand, every card that you win or lose in a fight will go in someone’s board. Early in the game, it helps to get a few cards into your board, to give yourself some leverage in the showdown. Later, you must do what you can to make sure you hold a Key Card for the right lifeboat. You will notice that the more valuable a lifeboat is, the fewer points it will require to board (the majority of that suit is in the lifeboat, and not in players’ hands.) Discretion is the better part of valor: it’s better to get into a small lifeboat than to try for a big one and lose. Learn to guess what the other players will probably go for, and play accordingly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Variation for 6-8 Players:</strong> You can play Abandon Ship! with as many as eight players, by shuffling together two decks. Deal eight hands regardless of how many players are in the game, and remove the unused hands from the game. To resolve ties during the showdown, if both players have a card of the same rank as their highest card in their Key suit, compare the second highest cards in each hand, and so on. If tied hands are exactly identical, it’s time to set up the plank.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
