Turn the 4 face up and use the face down 6 to cover all pips on the card. As you score points, reveal that number of pips. When the score becomes greater than 4, flip the 6 face up and use the face up 4 to gradually reveal pips as you score points. This way the amount visible pips on both cards is the teams total score.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nathan's Notes:</strong> I learned this at Viget25 from Brian DiChiara and was surprised at how fast it played. It's less precise than Spades (since the bid is always at least 3) and it's a bit easier to remember what's been played with the lower card count. This makes for a lighter and breezier game. Playing to 10 also doesn't last too long, so it's easy to reset and try again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

There's still a lot of depth in play, especially since you're trying to AVOID taking tricks—it feels like a game of Dodgeball with the Queen of Spades lurking in someone's hand. Shooting the Moon is very tough, as it can easily be broken if someone notices what you're doing, but exists as a nice REVERSE-SUPLEX if you can pull it off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Players may not have more than three reserved cards in hand, and the only way to get rid of a card is to buy it (see below).</p>\n<p>Reserving a card is also the only way to get a gold token (joker). If there is no gold left, you can still reserve a card, but you won’t get any gold.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buying-a-development-card\" tabindex=\"-1\">Buying a development card <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/splendor/#buying-a-development-card\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To purchase a card, a player must spend the number of tokens indicated on the card.

The spent tokens (including any jokers) are returned to the middle of the table.</p>\n<p>A player may purchase one of the face-up development cards in the middle of the table or a card in his hand that was reserved on a previous turn.</p>\n<p>Each player makes distinct rows with the acquired development cards by sorting them by color, and staggering them vertically so that their bonuses and prestige point values are visible.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The bonuses and prestige points granted by each card must be visible to all at all times.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Important: when a development card from the middle of the table is acquired or reserved, it must immediately be replaced by a card of the same level.</p>\n<p>At all times during the game, there must be 4 face-up cards of each level (unless the deck in question is empty, in which case the empty spaces also remain empty).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"the-bonuses\" tabindex=\"-1\">The bonuses <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/splendor/#the-bonuses\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The bonuses a player has from development cards acquired on previous turns provide discounts on the purchase of new cards. Each bonus of a given color is equal to a token of that color.</p>\n<p>Thus, if a player has 2 blue bonuses and wants to purchase a card which costs 2 blue tokens and 1 green token, the player must only spend 1 green token.</p>\n<p>If a player has enough development cards (and therefore bonuses), they can even purchase a card without spending any tokens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-nobles\" tabindex=\"-1\">The nobles <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/splendor/#the-nobles\">#</a></h3>\n<p>At the <strong>end of their turn</strong>, each player checks the noble tiles in order to determine if they’re receiving a visit from one of them.

The total value of the cards is it's <strong>capture number</strong> and is the sum of the cards and must be announced.</li>\n<li><strong>The player must have the number card that can make that capture in order to for the build to be legal.</strong></li>\n<li>A build must include a card you <strong>just played</strong>, it cannot be only made of cards that were only on the table.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><mark>(A 3 is placed on a 2 as 'building 5', while the player ALSO has a 5 in their hand).</mark></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>single build</strong> consists of two or more cards whose capture values add up to the capture value of the build\n<ul>\n<li><mark>(a 5-build made of a 2 and a 3, or a 10-build made of A-4-5.)</mark></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A <strong>multiple build</strong> consists of two or more cards or sets of cards, each of which equates to the capture value of the building\n<ul>\n<li><mark>(a 5-build made of a 2 and a 3 <strong>plus</strong> a 4 and an ace, or a 5-build made of A-4 and 5, or a 9-build made of two nines, or a 9-build made of 6-3 plus 5-4 plus 9.)</mark></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cards which have been made into a build can subsequently only be captured as a unit, never separately.</p>\n<p>The capturing number of a multiple build can never be changed. If the original build of two threes in the above example had been announced as building three (rather than building six), it would not be possible for a player holding a two and a five to add the two to the build, making five, not for a player holding a two and an eight to add the two making eight.</p>\n<h4 id=\"capturing-a-build\" tabindex=\"-1\">Capturing a build <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/casino/#capturing-a-build\">#</a></h4>\n<p>A build can be captured by <strong>playing a number card of the same value of it's most recent capture number</strong>. It is possible to &quot;steal&quot; a build created by another player if you have the right number card.</p>\n<p>If you've made or modified a build that no one has since modified, you are <strong>not allowed to trail a card</strong> (you must capture or build). You are also not allowed to play in a way to leave yourself with no card equal to the capture number of the build you made (which would make the build illegal).</p>\n<p>While capturing a build, you can <strong>also capture any loose cards on the table that add up to the same number</strong>. <mark>(You have made a build of 9 and there is a 5 on the table. If the player before you plays a 4, you can capture the 4 and the 5 at the same time that you take in your build.)</mark></p>\n<p><strong>It is not possible to capture a build with a card of any other rank than that announced for the build.</strong> <mark>(The table contains a 4 and a 3 combined into a build of 7, plus a separate 2. You cannot play a 9 to take the build of 7 plus the 2 - the build can only be captured with a 7.)</mark></p>\n<p><mark><strong>Another example:</strong> the table contains a 5 and a player plays another 5 on it, they must either announcing &quot;building 10&quot; to create a single build or &quot;building 5&quot; to create a multiple build. If &quot;building 10&quot; was announced the build can only be captured by a 10, not by a 5. If &quot;building 5&quot; was announced, the build can only be captured by a 5, not by a 10.</mark></p>\n<h4 id=\"modifying-a-build\" tabindex=\"-1\">Modifying a build <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/casino/#modifying-a-build\">#</a></h4>\n<p>There are two ways of adding to a build:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may <strong>add a card from your hand to a single build, increasing the capturing number</strong>, provided that you also hold a card which will capture the new build. <mark>(Example A and B)</mark></li>\n<li>You may also add a card from your hand to a build and <strong>incorporate additional cards from the table into the build, if they are equal to the new capturing number</strong>. In this case the build will become multiple. You can never use a card from the table to change the value of a single build. <mark>(Example B and C)</mark></li>\n<li>You may add to any build, single or multiple, by playing a card from your hand which, <strong>either alone or combined with other cards on the table which are not yet in builds, matches the existing capture number of the build</strong>, provided that you hold a card which can capture the combined build. <mark>(Example D)</mark></li>\n</ol>\n<p><mark><strong>Example A:</strong> The table contains a build consisting of two threes, announced as a build of six. If you hold a two and an eight, you can add the two to the build announcing &quot;building 8&quot;. The next player, holding an ace and a nine, could then add the ace and say &quot;building 9&quot;.</mark></p>\n<p><mark><strong>Example B:</strong> The table contains an ace, a two and a four; the ace and the four have been combined by a previous player into a build of five. You hold a three, an eight and a ten. You can play your three onto the single five-build and announce &quot;building eight&quot;, but you are not allowed to incorporate the two from the table into this build to make it a build of ten.</mark></p>\n<p><mark><strong>Example C:</strong> The table contains a three and a four, built into a seven, and a separate nine. You hold a two and a nine. You can play your two, combining it with the seven-build to make nine, and at the same time incorporate the nine on the table into the build, converting it to a multiple build and saying &quot;building nine&quot;.</mark></p>\n<p><mark><strong>Example D:</strong> The table contains a 9-build consisting of a 5 and a 4, and there is also a 3 on the table. You hold a six and two nines. You can play your 6, combining it with the 3 and the existing build to make a new multiple build of 9. Then on your next turn (provided that no one else captured) you could add one of the nines from your hand to the build. Finally, on the following turn, you could capture the whole build with your second nine.</mark></p>\n<p>Note that when making or adding to a build, <strong>you must contribute a card to it from your hand</strong>. You cannot just combine various cards which are already on the table to form a build. Note also that once a build contains more than one card or sets of cards which add to the capturing number, it is a multiple build and the capturing number can no longer be changed.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>Example:</strong> There is a multiple 8-build of 3-5-8 on the table, and there is also a loose 6 on the table. In your hand you have 2, 8, 8, 10. You may add one of your 8s to the build, making 3-5-8-8, or to add your 2 together with the 6 on the table, making 3-5-8-2-6, still with capture value 8. You cannot use your 2 to change the capture value to 10.</mark></p>\n<h3 id=\"trailing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Trailing <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/casino/#trailing\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If you play a card without building or capturing, the card is placed face up on the table alongside any other layout cards and remains there to be captured or built on in future. It is then the next player's turn. You are allowed to trail a card even if that card could have made a capture.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose that in a four player partnership game your partner has two tens and you have one. Your partner plays a 10 and the next player does not take it. On your turn, if you suspect that your partner has a second 10, you can play your 10 and not capture, leaving both tens on the table for your partner.</mark></p>\n<p>The only case in which trailing is not allowed is when there is a build on the table which you were the last player to add to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ending-a-round\" tabindex=\"-1\">Ending a Round <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/casino/#ending-a-round\">#</a></h2>\n<p>When all the cards have been played in the final deal, <strong>the last player who made a capture also wins any cards which are left on the table</strong> (these cards are sometimes known as the 'residue'). That is why it is important that the dealer should announce &quot;last&quot; when dealing the last cards.</p>\n<p><mark><strong>Hint on tactics:</strong> it is often good for the dealer to hold back a face card to play last if possible; this will capture a matching face card on the table and thereby also win any other table cards that remain.</mark></p>\n<h2 id=\"scoring\" tabindex=\"-1\">Scoring <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/casino/#scoring\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Each player (or team) counts their score based on the pile of cards they have won. There are eleven possible points in each hand:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Criteria</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Points</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Most Cards</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Most Spades</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Every Ace</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1 each</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Ten of diamonds (Big Casino)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Two of spades (Little Casino)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Sweep</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If there is a tie for most cards or most spades, no one gets those points.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sweep\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sweep <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/casino/#sweep\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A sweep occurs when <strong>a player takes all the cards from the table</strong>, leaving it empty and forcing the next player to trail. When making a sweep, the capturing card is stored face-up in the pile of won cards, so that the number of sweeps can be checked when scoring. It is possible to make a sweep with the last card of the final deal if it captures all the cards on the table, but if it does not, taking the remaining cards from the table because you made the last capture (the 'residue') does not count as a sweep.</p>\n<h3 id=\"winning-the-game\" tabindex=\"-1\">Winning the Game <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/casino/#winning-the-game\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Whoever first reaches the agreed-upon total (either 11 or 21 points), over however many rounds it takes, wins the game. If two people reach the target on the same round, whoever has the higher score wins. If there is a tie, another round is played.</p>\n<p><em>Original rules from <a href=\"https://www.pagat.com/fishing/casino.html\">Pagat</a>, modified and reorganized by Nathan Long.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nathan's Notes:</strong> This is a great small group game, and likely different than what most folks are used to in simple card games (Rummy, Uno, etc).

Whether you release the 7 or the King will depend on what you think your opponent has. If you saw him/her take a King earlier, then you may want to hold onto your King and play the 7.</p>\n<p>Play is simultaneous - there are no turns - everyone plays as fast as they can. However, a player is only allowed to look at one pile at a time. The pile you are holding must be put back face down on the table before can pick up and look at another pile.</p>\n<p>You cannot exchange more than one card at a time.

In the following hands, the player who <strong>dominoed</strong> (ran out of tiles) in the previous hand plays first. If the last hand was blocked, then the lead is again determined by lot.</p>\n<p>The lead can be <strong>any tile</strong> in the player's hand.</p>\n<p>The following players must play a tile matching the free end of one of the tiles at the ends of the layout. Doubles are played crosswise and count as the total of their pips for scoring purposes so long as they are at the end of one of the arms of the layout, with no tile yet played against the other side of the double.</p>\n<p>The first double, and only the first double, played is used as a 'spinner': the first and second tiles adjacent to the spinner must be placed against the two sides, then the third and fourth tiles must be placed against the ends.</p>\n<p>A player who cannot play a tile must draw tiles from the boneyard until he has a tile to play or the boneyard is empty. When a player draws a playable tile, it goes on the table immediately and the player's turn ends. When the boneyard becomes empty a player who has no tile to play passes and it is the next player's turn.</p>\n<p>The hand continues until one player dominoes (plays their last tile) or until all players are blocked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scoring\" tabindex=\"-1\">Scoring <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/all-fives/#scoring\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After a player has set a tile, the two, three or four ends of the tableau are totaled. If this total is a multiple of five (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 35 points), the player immediately scores that number of points. A double on the end of an arm of the tableau scores the total of its pips; that is [5-5] is worth ten points in the total, [6-6] is worth twelve points and so forth.</p>\n<p>The first double (spinner) is scored in the same way. Both ends count until tiles have been placed against both of its sides. When the second tile is played against the spinner, the spinner no longer contributes to the score: only the tiles at the two ends of the layout count, just as if the spinner was another tile placed in line. This can be confusing because the ends of the spinner are still open for setting other tiles.</p>\n<p>When the third tile is played against the spinner, creating a new arm extending from one of its ends, this third arm also counts towards the total, and when the fourth arm is begun by by extending the other end of the spinner all four ends count.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>. The diagrams below show the first nine moves of a possible game. The black arrows show the directions in which the layout can be extended, and the red stars show the tile ends that contribute to the total, which must be a multiple of 5 for the player to score for the move.</p>\n<figure class=\"inset-small mx-auto\">\n<img src=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/img/all-fives-01.svg\" alt=\"Move 1\" />\n<figcaption>move one - 5 points</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr />\n<figure class=\"inset mx-auto\">\n<img src=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/img/all-fives-02.svg\" alt=\"Move 1\" />\n<figcaption>\nmove two - 0 points\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr />\n<figure class=\"inset mx-auto\">\n<img src=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/img/all-fives-03.svg\" alt=\"Move 1\" />\n<figcaption>\nmove three - 10 points\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>When a double is at the end of an arm, both ends of the double are counted, but only until another tile is played extending from the free side of the double.</p>\n<hr />\n<figure class=\"inset mx-auto\">\n<img src=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/img/all-fives-04.svg\" alt=\"Move 1\" />\n  <figcaption>\n  move four - 5 points\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The [1-1], not the [4-4], was the first double played, so it is only from the [1-1] that the third and fourth arms of the cross can be started, and only after tiles have been played on both sides of the [1-1].</p>\n<hr />\n<figure class=\"inset mx-auto\">\n<img src=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/img/all-fives-05.svg\" alt=\"Move 1\" />\n  <figcaption>move five - 5 points</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr />\n<figure class=\"inset mx-auto\">\n<img src=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/img/all-fives-06.svg\" alt=\"Move 1\" />\n  <figcaption>move six - 10 points</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr />\n<figure class=\"inset mx-auto\">\n<img src=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/img/all-fives-07.svg\" alt=\"Move 1\" />\n  <figcaption>move seven - 15 points</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr />\n<figure class=\"inset mx-auto\">\n<img src=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/img/all-fives-08.svg\" alt=\"Move 1\" />\n  <figcaption>move eight - 5 points</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr />\n<figure class=\"inset mx-auto\">\n<img src=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/img/all-fives-09.svg\" alt=\"Move 1\" />\n  <figcaption>move nine - 0 points</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>When the hand ends, because some player runs out of tiles or the layout is blocked with no further plays possible.

In a three-player game if two players tie for least they split the third player's points between them.</p>\n<p>The game is played up to an agreed number of points, usually <strong>250 points for two players and 200 points with three or four players.</strong></p>\n<p>It is common to <strong>divide all the scores by five</strong>, so that for example a total of 15 on the ends of the layout scores 3 points. The game can then be scored on a Cribbage board, and the winning target is <strong>61 points</strong>. (But it's 50 to make 250 points??)</p>\n<h2 id=\"strategy\" tabindex=\"-1\">Strategy <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/all-fives/#strategy\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>As in any domino game, the player who can count the outstanding tiles has a strong advantage.</li>\n<li>Beginning players have trouble doing the required math in their heads. They will tend to think in terms of arms which end in 5, instead of looking for other combinations that give a multiple of five. Also, beginners do not think of reducing the previous total to a multiple of five.</li>\n<li>The highest possible score in one play is 35 points, which is obtained by having the [6-6], [5-5] and [4-4] tiles on the ends of three arms of the layout and a tile which shows a 5 on the fourth arm.</li>\n<li>When you have the lead, play a tile worth ten points ([5-5] or [4-6]) if possible to score early. Otherwise, play a double that gives you control the arms of the tableau.</li>\n<li>When another player draws a tile, you have information as to what was missing in his hand. If he draws one tile and plays it, you know that if you can force the tableau to end in the values he was missing, you will force him to draw more tiles.</li>\n<li>The smaller the total you leave to the next player, the smaller the total he can make from it.</li>\n<li>You can play to score, to block or to domino. In the scoring game, you attempt to get the largest score without regard to who dominoes. The scoring game is the obvious strategy and it is probably what you will pursue at the start of the game when you do not know the distribution of the tiles.\n<ul>\n<li>In the blocking game, you try to force a blocked game with the intent that you will get the lowest negative score. The blocking game is an end game strategy which depends on counting suits to see that there are no tiles outstanding in the suits on the arms of the tableau.</li>\n<li>Playing to domino is really a version of the blocking strategy, since you will have the lowest negative score, namely zero. However, it also has the advantage of giving you the lead in the following hand. That lead can be important if you are close to winning the game.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remember that being the one to domino is not always the same thing as getting the most points in a hand. Look for a suit where you are heavy or have control of the remaining tiles and try to get that suit exposed on one or more of the arms of the tableau to guarantee you have a play on your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"variants\" tabindex=\"-1\">Variants <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/all-fives/#variants\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Some play that the round begins with the highest double being played. (American Dominoes)</p>\n<p>Some play that the last tile or the last two tiles in the boneyard can never be drawn. If the boneyard is reduced to one (or two) tiles players who cannot play must pass and if all pass the game is blocked.</p>\n<p>Some play that a player or team must reach the target score (for example 61 on a cribbage board) exactly in order to win. This can happen during the play by playing a tile that makes a multiple of five on the ends of the layout or by scoring for the opponents' tiles at the end of a game. If a player overshoots by scoring too many points at once - for example 4 points from a score of 58 - those points are not scored and the game continues.</p>\n<p>Some play that at the end of a hand each player or team subtracts the total pip value of the tiles remaining in their hands, rounded to the nearest five, from their running total.</p>\n<h2 id=\"alternates\" tabindex=\"-1\">Alternates <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/all-fives/#alternates\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There's a variant called <strong>Muggins</strong> which plays the exact same, but there's no spinners. Because there's only ever two branches the combinations are simplified.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nathan's Notes:</strong> This is probably my favorite domino game, relatively chill, and fantastic with little ones to work on basic addition (without them knowing it). When playing with little ones I recommend the 'Muggins' variant to keep it from being overwhelming at first, then adding the single spinner as they get older to increase complexity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

When you play a mark, you pick up all the cards which match it, either by suit or by rank. The mark itself falls into the pool.

The marks are now played from highest to lowest, so the A♠ goes first, capturing the A♥ and the 9♠, and then falling in. The new pool contains the A♠, Q♣, and 5♥.

Be wary of where you put things or you may find something else in its place!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"set-up\" tabindex=\"-1\">Set up <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/bogey/#set-up\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Shuffle the deck and deal yourself an opening hand of 5 cards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-win\" tabindex=\"-1\">How to Win <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/bogey/#how-to-win\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The aim of the game is to play all the cards in as few columns as you can, despite the Bogey's intervention. The win criterion, in terms of number of columns, is as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Columns</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">novice</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">12 columns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">normal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">11 columns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">advanced</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">10 columns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">legendary</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">9 columns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">epic</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">8 columns</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-play-a-card-to-the-table\" tabindex=\"-1\">How to play a card to the table <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/bogey/#how-to-play-a-card-to-the-table\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Over the course of the game, columns of cards are built. In each column, the cards are of the same suit, and the cards must be decreasing in value (K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A) but may skip values. To play a card to the table it must be either added to the bottom of a column of the same suit containing only cards of a higher value, or placed to start a new column.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gameplay\" tabindex=\"-1\">Gameplay <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/bogey/#gameplay\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The game starts with an empty board. Play alternates between you and the bogie, starting with you.</p>\n<p>On your turn you first draw enough cards to bring your hand to five cards. For each card in your hand you must decide whether to play it to the table, discard it, or to hold on to it for the next turn.</p>\n<p>The bogey then takes his turn. He plays the next card in the deck either adding to an existing column or starting a new one. You may choose where the card is played. If it cannot be played legally the game is lost. Remember there is a limit of twelve columns.</p>\n<p>You can also choose to pass your turn, letting the bogey play multiple times in a row, in effect choosing to 'hold on' to all your cards (not discarding or playing any of them).</p>\n<p>When the deck has run out the discards are shuffled and become the deck.</p>\n<p><strong>A more difficult variant</strong>: A more difficult version of the game is to change the hand size to 4 (instead of 5). This means the bogey plays cards a higher proportion of the time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nathan's Notes:</strong> The chaos element of the bogey is simple but makes each play different, making it more interesting (to me) than standard solitaire variants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

You and your greedy pals are hustling around the deck of a sinking pirate ship, trying to scoop up as much treasure as you can carry. You’ll need to collect plenty of loot, so you can buy your way into a lifeboat, and the best lifeboats are the ones with the most treasure already in them. It’s complicated. Or maybe you’re just not very smart.</p>\n<p>In this game, Aces are worth 1 point, Jacks 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13. All other cards are worth their face value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This was a freely distributed game designed by James Ernest, distributed by Cheapass Games as a part of their Cheapass Games Poker Suite (no longer in publication).</small></p><p>\n</p><h2 id=\"overview\" tabindex=\"-1\">Overview <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#overview\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The game consists of several hands, or “rounds,” each of which ends when the last card is drawn from the deck, and the ship sinks. At the end of each round, players will compete to get on the lifeboats in a showdown, and they score points based on which lifeboat they board. If you board no lifeboat, you get no points for the round. The first player to earn 200 points wins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"play\" tabindex=\"-1\">Play <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#play\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"to-begin-each-round\" tabindex=\"-1\">To Begin Each Round: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#to-begin-each-round\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Shuffle the deck and deal five cards to each player. If there are only two players, deal five more cards and set them aside, face down. These cards will not be used. Play starts with the dealer, and the deal moves to the left after each round.</p>\n<h3 id=\"on-your-turn\" tabindex=\"-1\">On Your Turn <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#on-your-turn\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you do not have <strong>five cards</strong> in your hand, draw back up to five.\n<ul>\n<li>If you draw the <strong>last card</strong> off the deck, the ship sinks immediately, and you do not take the rest of your turn.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After you draw, you have two options: you may\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Discard one card</strong>, or</li>\n<li><strong>Pick a Fight</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"discarding\" tabindex=\"-1\">Discarding: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#discarding\">#</a></h4>\n<p>There are four discard piles, one for each suit. These represent lifeboats. When you discard a card, place it into the lifeboat of the appropriate suit, and your turn is over.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fighting\" tabindex=\"-1\">Fighting: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#fighting\">#</a></h4>\n<p>To pick a fight, play a card into the center of the table, and declare which player you are attacking. That player has two options: he can surrender and lose the fight, or he can play a card of higher rank than the card you played. (Suit doesn’t matter.)</p>\n<p>If your opponent plays a higher card, you may respond with an even higher card, or you may surrender. This continues until one player gives up, or can’t play a higher card.</p>\n<p>The winner of the fight draws a random card from the loser’s hand. That card goes into the winner’s “board,” which is a faceup collection of cards on the table in front of him.</p>\n<p>Board cards aren’t part of your hand. You can’t fight with them, discard them, or lose them in fights. They will help you in the showdown.</p>\n<p>After the fight, all cards which were played in the fight get sorted into the appropriate lifeboats. (Think of it as other pirates picking up all the stuff you threw at each other.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"important-restriction\" tabindex=\"-1\">Important Restriction: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#important-restriction\">#</a></h4>\n<p>You cannot play the last card in your hand, unless that card is a King. This rule ensures that the winner will always be able to draw a card from the loser’s hand.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pointless-restriction\" tabindex=\"-1\">Pointless Restriction: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#pointless-restriction\">#</a></h4>\n<p>You can’t challenge a player who is holding no cards. You’d have nothing to draw from him, and you can achieve the same result by simply discarding a card.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-showdown\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Showdown: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#the-showdown\">#</a></h4>\n<p>When the last card in the deck is drawn, the ship sinks. At this point, it’s time for each player to bribe his way into a lifeboat, in the phase called the “showdown.”</p>\n<p>Each player plays one card from his hand, face down. This card is called the Key Card, and it is a declaration of which lifeboat you’re running to. This means that you must be lucky enough to hold a card matching the lifeboat you want. If your hand is empty, which is rare, you will go down with the ship and score no points for the round. Once everyone has played a Key Card, reveal all the cards in everyone’s hand.</p>\n<p>If everyone ran for a <strong>different lifeboat</strong>, there’s no contest. Each player gets the point value of the cards in that lifeboat. You do not score the cards in your hand, your Key Card, or your board.</p>\n<p>If <strong>more than one person went for the same lifeboat</strong>, then only one player will get in. The points in the lifeboat will go to the player who is holding more points in the matching suit, including his hand, his board, and his Key Card. If there is a tie, it is broken in favor of the player who has the single highest card in that suit. As above, you score only the points in the lifeboat.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"scoring-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Scoring Example: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#scoring-example\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It’s the showdown in a four-player game. Player 1 plays a Spade, Players 2 and 3 play Hearts, and Player 4 plays nothing because his hand is empty. Player 1 gets the points in the Spade lifeboat, and Player 4 gets nothing.</p>\n<p>Players 2 and 3 have both gone for the Hearts lifeboat, so they must compete to get in. Compare all the Hearts they hold: Player 2 has the 6h on his board, played the Qh as his Key, and holds no other Hearts. Player 3 played the 2h as his Key, and held only the 3h and the 7h in his hand. Player 2 takes the lifeboat, with 18 total points of Hearts vs. Player 3’s 12 points. Player 3 scores nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"winning\" tabindex=\"-1\">Winning: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#winning\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Play to 200 points. If two players break 200 on the same round, the player with the highest score wins. If two players are tied for the high score, they must engage in the embarrassing Caribbean Plank Walk tied together with a ten-foot rope and clenching knives in their teeth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"strategy\" tabindex=\"-1\">Strategy: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://nathan-long.com/rules/games/abandon-ship/#strategy\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The cards that you discard and play in fights are crucial choices. Every card that you play in this manner will wind up in a lifeboat. On the other hand, every card that you win or lose in a fight will go in someone’s board.</li>\n<li>Early in the game, it helps to get a few cards into your board, to give yourself some leverage in the showdown. Later, you must do what you can to make sure you hold a Key Card for the right lifeboat.</li>\n<li>You will notice that the more valuable a lifeboat is, the fewer points it will require to board (the majority of that suit is in the lifeboat, and not in players’ hands.) Discretion is the better part of valor: it’s better to get into a small lifeboat than to try for a big one and lose. Learn to guess what the other players will probably go for, and play accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Variation for 6-8 Players:</strong> You can play Abandon Ship! with as many as eight players, by shuffling together two decks. Deal eight hands regardless of how many players are in the game, and remove the unused hands from the game. To resolve ties during the showdown, if both players have a card of the same rank as their highest card in their Key suit, compare the second highest cards in each hand, and so on. If tied hands are exactly identical, it’s time to set up the plank.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
