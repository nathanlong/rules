> A twist on 20 questions with secret roles where the Insider tries to stay hidden from the Master and Commons while manipulating the discussion to lead everyone to the correct answer.

<small><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Insider is copyright Oink games. What follows is a reinterpretation of the rules without the copyrighted flavor text.</small>

## Setup

1.  Deal out role cards: 1 **Master**, 1 **Insider**, and X **Commons** (as many as there are people left). Everyone secretly looks at their roles.
1.  Everyone closes their eyes except the Master who chooses a word card and displays it on the table.
1.  The master closes their eyes and tells the Insider to open their eyes (all other eyes remain closed), who then views the word secretly.
1.  The master calls for the Insider to close their eyes and covers the word.
1.  The master tells everyone to open their eyes and play begins.

## Guessing Begins

1. A timer is set for **5 minutes**.
1. Everyone (Commons and Insider) ask **free-for-all yes/no/don't know questions** to the Master about the word.
    - There is no limit to amount of questions, they must only be phrased as yes/no/don't know questions.
    - The insider tries subtly direct everyone else to the answer without revealing their identity.
    - The master is in a good position to pay attention to who is the Insider, since they don't have to guess the word.
    - If the word has two possible meanings (ex. tear in the eye vs tear in clothing), the Master should choose only one of the meanings.
1. **The timer stops** when the word is guessed
    - If the timer runs out before the word is guessed, everyone loses.
1. **The timer is flipped** and the remaining time is used for the voting round
    - For example, if the word is guessed after 3 minutes have passed, the voting round will last for 3 minutes. If guessed in 1 minute, the voting round will last for 1 minute.

## Voting Begins

1. Everyone participates in the **discussion** of who they think the Insider is, including the Master. Two votes are taken.
1. **First Vote**: Group tries to decide if the person who guessed correctly is the Insider.
    - A majority is required to accuse, a tie is not sufficient to accuse.
    - If accused, the guesser reveals their card/role.
    - If they incorrectly accuse the guesser, the Insider wins and the game is over.
    - If they correctly accuse, the Master and Commons win and the game is over.
    - If the vote does not accuse the guesser, it moves to the second vote.
1. **Second Vote:** If the first vote is not successful, on the count of 3 everyone simultaneously points to who they think it is.
    - The person with the most votes is accused as the Insider (majority not required).
    - The Master decides a tie.
    - If the Insider is found, the Master wins along with the Commons.
    - If the Insider is not found (another player is chosen), the Insider wins.

## Setup Tips

- Word cards can be chosen from other games like Apples to Apples or Codenames.
- As a variant, or if word cards are not available, words can also be written down freely by the Master.
- Role cards can be from a standard deck of cards (Ace for Insider, King for Master, numbers for commons, etc)

> **Nathan's Notes:** This is a great scaling group game that requires almost no materials. If there aren't any playing cards, someone can be a Facilitator and pick the Master and Insider and manage the opening closing of eyes.
