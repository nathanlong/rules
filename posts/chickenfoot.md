> ## Description:
>
> Chickenfoot is a fun and easy to learn domino game. The goal is to try to get rid of as many dominoes as possible and have the lowest score based on the dominoes remaining before your opponents can do the same.

## Starting off Rounds

Each player draws a set of dominoes from a shuffled face down the pile to create their “hand”, making sure the domino values are concealed from their opponents. The number of dominoes each player draws varies with the number of players and amount of dominoes used (more players can be accommodated with a larger set):

<div class="table-full">

|Players  |2    |3    |4    |5    |6    |7    |8    |9    |10   |11   |12   |
|:---     |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Double 9 |14   |10   |7    |6    |5    |-    |-    |-    |-    |-    |-    |
|Double 12|-    |-    |12   |10   |8    |7    |6    |5    |-    |-    |-    |
|Double 15|-    |-    |-    |-    |12   |10   |9    |8    |7    |7    |6    |

</div>

> Note: These draw tables differ from other rule sets because of the "No Draw" round ending rules specific to our version of the game. We need more tiles in the chicken yard

The leftover dominoes are placed on the side and referred to as the “chicken yard”.

Chicken foot establishes a round with a starting **“double”** (a tile with the same amount of pips or the same number on each end) placed as the centerpiece. You begin with the highest double (for a double 9 set, you begin the first round with the double 9 domino.)

The subsequent rounds begin with the **next highest double**, double 8, and the following round double 7, all the way to double 0 for a total of ten rounds (with a Double 9 set, 13 for Double 12, 16 for Double 15).

The starting double is set aside at the beginning of each round and placed in the center.

> Alternate: If no one has the required starting double in their hand then each player simultaneously draws a domino from the chicken yard until it is found and a starting player is determined.

Going clockwise, the next player must play a domino from their hand off the starting double. This domino must have a matching end to the starting double. If they do not have one, they draw a domino from the chicken yard and play that if possible. If not, the player calls “Pass” and the turn moves to the next player. The following player repeats the process of trying to play off the starting double and this continues until all 4 sides of the centerpiece are filled.

> Alternate: The centerpiece can require 6 sides to be considered filled.

## Subsequent Turns

After all the sides are played off the starting double, play can continue off any exposed end domino as long as the ends match.

[diagram: Matching Dominoes end to end]

If the player is unable to add a domino, then the player must draw a domino from the chicken yard and play that domino immediately if they are able to. Otherwise, they must pass.

If there are no dominoes remaining to draw from, the round ends.

> Alternate: If there are no dominoes to draw, the player simply passes (loses a turn) and play continues until someone goes out or no legal plays can be made, see 'Ending a Round'

## The Chickenfoot

If a player plays a double, the double must be placed perpendicular to the domino played off of. The player then calls “Chickie” plus the numbers played. For example, if a double 5 was played, the player would call “Chickie Fives.” The next three plays must be made off that double, creating an arrangement that resembles a chicken foot.

If the player is unable to play on that double, he must draw from the chicken yard and play that domino if possible or else pass. Once the Chickenfoot has completed, the plays can continue off any exposed matching end again.

## Chicken Little / "Bok Bok"

When a player places a tile and has one domino remaining, they must announce it by saying, "BOK BOK!" (or some other variant of a chicken noise) before their hand leaves the table (returns to pass their own dominoes). If a player does not announce their last tile, other players can call them out and the player who failed to announce must draw a tile from the "chicken yard".

## Completing a round

A round is completed when one player plays the last domino in their hand (goes out) OR a player cannot make a legal play AND there are no dominoes in the "chicken yard".

> Alternate: The round ends when a player goes out or NO players are able to make a legal play.

At this point, each player records their points for the round by totaling the number of pips from the dominoes remaining in their hand. The double 0 tiles scores as 50 points.

## Completing the game

The game ends after all rounds are played (through to the Double 0). The player with the lowest total score for all the rounds wins!
