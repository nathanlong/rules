## Setup:

Scoundrel is played with a standard deck of playing cards.

Search through the deck and remove all Jokers, Red Face Cards and Red Aces. Place them off to the side, they are not used in this game.

Shuffle the remaining cards and place the pile face down on your left. This deck is called the **Dungeon**.

Take out a piece of paper and pen (or use your memory). Mark down 20 on the piece of paper, this is your starting **Health**.

## Rules:

The 26 **Clubs ♣︎** and **Spades ♠︎** in the deck are **Monsters**. Their damage is equal to their ordered value. (e.g. 10 is 10, Jack is 11, Queen is 12, King is 13, and Ace is 14)

The 9 **Diamonds ♦︎** in the deck are **Weapons**. Each weapon does as much damage as its value. All weapons in Scoundrel are binding, meaning if you pick one up, you must equip it, and discard your previous weapon.

The 9 **Hearts ♥︎** in the deck are **Health Potions**. You may only use one health potion each turn, even if you pull two. The second potion you pull is simply discarded. You may not restore your life beyond your starting 20 health.

You may locate the discard deck (any discarded cards) anywhere you wish, though I recommend to the right of the **Room**. Cards are discarded face down.

The Game ends when either your life reaches 0 or you make your way through the entire **Dungeon**.

## Gameplay:

On your first and every turn, flip over cards off the top of the deck, one by one, until you have 4 cards face up in front of you to make a **Room**.

You may avoid the **Room** if you wish. If you chose to do so, scoop up all four cards in one motion and place them at the bottom of the Dungeon. While you may avoid as many **Rooms** as you want, you may not avoid two **Rooms** in a row.

If you choose not to avoid the **Room**, one by one, you must face 3 of the four cards it contains.

Take them one at a time.

Once you have chosen 3 cards (such that only one remains), your turn is complete. Leave the fourth card face up in front of you as part of the next Room.

### If you chose a Weapon...

You must equip it. Do this by placing it face up between you and the remaining **Room** cards. If you had a previous **Weapon** equipped, move it and any **Monsters** on it to the discard deck.

### If you chose a Health Potion...

Add its number to your health, and than discard it. Your health may not exceed 20, and you may not use more than one **Health Potion** per turn. If you take two **Health Potions** on a single turn, the second is simply discarded, adding nothing to your health.

### If you chose a Monster...

You may either fight it **barehanded** or with an equipped **Weapon**.

If you choose to fight the Monster **barehanded**, subtract its full value from your Health, and move the Monster to the discard deck.

If you choose to fight the Monster with your equipped **Weapon**, place the monster face up on top of the weapon (and on top of any other Monsters on the Weapon. Be sure to stagger the placement of the Monster so that the Weapon's number is still showing. subtract the Weapon's value from the Monster's value and subtract any remaining value from your health.

> For example, if your Weapon is a 5, and you place a 3 Monster on it, you take no damage. ( 3-5 < 0). If your Weapon is a 5 and you place a Jack Monster on it, you take 6 damage. ( 11 - 5 = 5 dmg)

It is important to note that although you retain your weapons until they are replaced, once a Weapon is used on a monster, the Weapon can then only be used to slay Monsters of a lower value (less than equal) than the previous Monster it had slain.

> For example, if your 5 Weapon has killed a Queen Monster and you then choose a 6 Monster, you may use your Weapon on the 6 Monster, as 6 is less than 12. But, if you have used your 5 Weapon on a 6 Monster, and you then choose a Queen Monster, you must fight the Queen barehanded as Queen,12, is greater than 6. Despite this, the Weapon is not discarded, as it could still be used against Monsters weaker than a 6.

## Scoring

If your life has reached zero, find all the remaining monsters in the Dungeon, and subtract their values from your life, this negative value is your score.

If you have made your way through the entire dungeon, your score is your positive life, or if your life is 20, and your last card was a health potion, your life + the value of that potion.

> **Nathan's Notes:** This game is HARD to complete, making actually escaping very rewarding. Keeping track of your life can be difficult to do mentally, so having a tracker or pen and paper offloads that overhead.
