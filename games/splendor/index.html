<p>Shuffle each development card deck separately, and then place them in a column in the middle of the table in increasing order from <strong>bottom to top</strong> (‚óã;‚óã‚óã;‚óã‚óã‚óã).</p>
<p>Then reveal 4 cards from each level.</p>
<p>Shuffle the noble tiles and reveal <strong>as many of them as there are players plus one</strong> (example: 5 tiles for a 4 player game).</p>
<p>The remaining tiles are removed from the game; they will not be used during the game.</p>
<p>Finally, place the tokens in 6 distinct piles (sort them by color) within reach of the players.</p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="the-development-cards" tabindex="-1">The development cards <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-development-cards">#</a></h3>
<p>To win prestige points, the players must purchase development cards. These cards are visible in the middle of the table and may be purchased by all players during the game.</p>
<p>The developments in hand are the cards which the players reserve throughout the game. Developments in hand may only be purchased by the players holding them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The player who purchases this card wins 4 prestige points. Owning this card allows the player to benefit from a blue bonus. To purchase this card, the player must spend 3 blue tokens, 3 black tokens, and 6 white tokens</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-noble-tiles" tabindex="-1">The noble tiles <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-noble-tiles">#</a></h3>
<p>The noble tiles are visible in the middle of the table. At the end of their turn, a player automatically receives the visit from a noble if that player has the amount of bonuses (and only bonuses) required, and they get the corresponding tile.</p>
<p>A player cannot refuse a visit from a noble.</p>
<p>Receiving a noble isn‚Äôt considered to be an action. Each noble tile is worth 3 prestige points, but players can only get a single one per turn</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The player who acquires this noble‚Äôs tile gains 3 prestige points. If a player has enough development cards to amass 3 blue bonuses, 3 green bonuses, and 3 white bonuses, then that player automatically receives a visit from that noble.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rules" tabindex="-1">Rules <a class="header-anchor" href="#rules">#</a></h2>
<p>The youngest player begins. Play then proceeds clockwise. On their turn, a player must choose to perform only one of the following four actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take 3 gem tokens of different colors.</li>
<li>Take 2 gem tokens of the same color. This action is only possible if there are at least 4 tokens of the chosen color left when the player takes them.</li>
<li>Reserve 1 development card and take 1 gold token (joker).</li>
<li>Purchase 1 face-up development card from the middle of the table or a previously reserved one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="selecting-tokens" tabindex="-1">Selecting tokens <a class="header-anchor" href="#selecting-tokens">#</a></h3>
<p>A player can never have more than 10 tokens at the end of their turn (including jokers). If this happens, they must return tokens until they only have 10 left. A player can return all or some of those they‚Äôve just drawn. The tokens owned by a player must be visible by all players at all times.</p>
<p><em>Reminder: players may not take 2 tokens of the same color if there are less than 4 tokens available of that color.</em></p>
<h3 id="reserve-a-development-card" tabindex="-1">Reserve a development card <a class="header-anchor" href="#reserve-a-development-card">#</a></h3>
<p>To reserve a card, a player simply needs to take a face-up development from the middle of the table or (if you‚Äôre feeling lucky) draw the first card from one of the three decks (level ‚óã;‚óã‚óã;‚óã‚óã‚óã) without showing it to the other players.</p>
<p>The reserved cards are kept in hand and cannot be discarded. Players may not have more than three reserved cards in hand, and the only way to get rid of a card is to buy it (see below).</p>
<p>Reserving a card is also the only way to get a gold token (joker). If there is no gold left, you can still reserve a card, but you won‚Äôt get any gold.</p>
<h3 id="buying-a-development-card" tabindex="-1">Buying a development card <a class="header-anchor" href="#buying-a-development-card">#</a></h3>
<p>To purchase a card, a player must spend the number of tokens indicated on the card. A joker token can replace any color. The spent tokens (including any jokers) are returned to the middle of the table.</p>
<p>A player may purchase one of the face-up development cards in the middle of the table or a card in his hand that was reserved on a previous turn.</p>
<p>Each player makes distinct rows with the acquired development cards by sorting them by color, and staggering them vertically so that their bonuses and prestige point values are visible.</p>
<hr>
<p>The bonuses and prestige points granted by each card must be visible to all at all times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Important: when a development card from the middle of the table is acquired or reserved, it must immediately be replaced by a card of the same level.</p>
<p>At all times during the game, there must be 4 face-up cards of each level (unless the deck in question is empty, in which case the empty spaces also remain empty).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-bonuses" tabindex="-1">The bonuses <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-bonuses">#</a></h3>
<p>The bonuses a player has from development cards acquired on previous turns provide discounts on the purchase of new cards. Each bonus of a given color is equal to a token of that color.</p>
<p>Thus, if a player has 2 blue bonuses and wants to purchase a card which costs 2 blue tokens and 1 green token, the player must only spend 1 green token.</p>
<p>If a player has enough development cards (and therefore bonuses), they can even purchase a card without spending any tokens.</p>
<h3 id="the-nobles" tabindex="-1">The nobles <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-nobles">#</a></h3>
<p>At the <strong>end of their turn</strong>, each player checks the noble tiles in order to determine if they‚Äôre receiving a visit from one of them. A player can be visited if they have (at least) the quantity and type of bonuses indicated on the noble tile.</p>
<p>It is impossible to refuse the visit from a noble, which is not considered to be an action.</p>
<p>If a player has enough bonuses to be visited by more than one noble at the end of their turn, that player chooses the noble to be received.</p>
<p>The tile obtained is placed face-up in front of the player in question.</p>
<h2 id="end-of-the-game" tabindex="-1">End of the game <a class="header-anchor" href="#end-of-the-game">#</a></h2>
<p>When a player reaches <strong>15 prestige points</strong>, complete the current round so that each player has played the same number of turns.</p>
<p>The player who then has the highest number of prestige points is declared the winner (don‚Äôt forget to count your nobles). In case of a tie, the player who has purchased the fewest development cards wins.</p>
