> Eat üí© You üê± is a (game? activity?) where players doodle and caption a chain of increasingly surreal events.

## Setup

Each player starts with:

- A piece of paper (or a stack of index cards).
- A pencil (or something to write and draw with).

## Play

1. At the top of their paper, each player writes a short sentence or phrase (esoteric stuff often yields humorous results).
2. Papers are passed to the left, where the next player "draws" the sentence (think Pictionary), folds the paper so only the drawing is visible, and passes it to their left.
3. The next player examines the drawing, and writes a sentence that they think the drawing represents... this continues until all players have their original back (or with large groups, an odd number of times, until a ‚Äúfinal‚Äù sentence/phrase is written).
4. At the end, everyone unfolds their paper. Everyone laughs to see something like, and much hilarity ensues as "I am the Walrus, koo-koo-ca-choo" becomes "Hitler and I danced the night away in a disco."

### Multi-Page Variant:

If a lot of players are involved, it may be hard to fold the paper enough times and still have space to write and draw.

- Each player receives a stack of index cards (or other size) equal to the amount of players.
- Everyone writes or draws as normal, then adds their card to the top of the stack.
- The stack is then passed to the left.
- When players run out of cards they should have received their original prompt back.
