> This is a variant of **Zhēng Shàngyóu / 争上游** (which roughly translates to **Struggling Upstream**) [as catalogued by John Owen](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3173891/how-i-play-zheng-shangyou).


## Setup

- 2 players = 26 cards
- 3 players = 18 cards
- 4 players = 13 cards
- 6 players = 9 cards

## Card Order

The card rankings in ascending order:

- 3 through Ace, as normal
- 2, wild
- Black Joker, wild
- Red Joker, wild

Suits do not matter!

## Combos

- **Single:** One card played by itself.
- **Pair:** Two cards of the same rank.
- **Trip:** Three cards of the same rank.
- **Full House:** Three card of the same rank plus two cards of the same rank. Ranked by triple.
- **Straight:** Five or more cards of consecutive rank. No 2s or Jokers allowed.
- **Stair:** Two or more pairs of consecutive rank.
- **Plate:** Two or more triples of consecutive rank.

Clarifications:

- Natural combos beat wild combos.

## Bombs

- **Quad:** Four cards of the same rank
- **Rocket:** Black Joker plus Red Joker

## Rules

The player holding the **3 of Spades** leads first (but is not required to play the 3). This player may lead with any combination.

Standard climbing rules apply:

- A player must follow the lead combination, play a bomb, or pass.
- If a bomb is played, it can only be beaten by a higher bomb of the same type or a higher ranking bomb (higher quad beats lower quad, ultra bomb beats all quads)
- If any player passes, they may still play cards in the future if the play comes back around to them.
- When all players pass except one, then the table is cleared and the last person who did not pass leads any combination.

## Goal

First player to shed out wins. Last place shuffles for the next game.

## Scoring

Score isn't always kept, but if desired:

- 1st out scores 2.
- 2nd out scores 1.
- 3rd out scores 0.

First to make 6 points wins. If there's a tie, play another hand to break the tie.
