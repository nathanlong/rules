> A twist on 20 questions with secret roles where the Insider tries to stay hidden from the Master and Commons while manipulating the discussion to lead everyone to the correct answer.

## Overview

The game is played in 3 rounds:

1. Guessing
2. Discussion
3. Voting

## Setup

1. Deal out role cards: 1 **Master**, 1 **Insider**, and X **Commons** (as many as there are people left). Everyone secretly looks at their roles.
1. The master announces their role and instructs everyone to close their eyes.
1. The master flips the top card and the **theme** for the game is the word whose number matches the top card. (Alternately, the master can choose a word and write it on a card.)
1. The master closes their eyes and tells the Insider to open their eyes (all other eyes remain closed), who then views the word secretly.
1. The master calls for the Insider to close their eyes and covers the word.
1. The master tells everyone to open their eyes and play begins.

## Guessing Begins

1. A timer is set for **5 minutes**.
1. Everyone (Commons and Insider) ask **free-for-all yes/no/don't know questions** to the **Master** about the word.
    - There is no limit to amount of questions, they must only be phrased as yes/no/don't know questions.
    - The **Insider** tries subtly direct everyone else to the answer without revealing their identity.
    - The **Commons** need to ask questions to find the theme and also work out who the **Insider** is.
    - The **Master** is in a good position to pay attention to who is the **Insider**, since they don't have to guess the word.
    - If the word has two possible meanings (ex. tear in the eye vs tear in clothing), the **Master** should choose only **one** of the meanings.
1. **The timer stops** when the word is guessed.
    - The person who guessed the word is now the **Guesser**
1. **The timer is flipped** and the remaining time is used for the voting round
    - For example, if the word is guessed after 3 minutes have passed, the voting round will last for 3 minutes. If guessed in 1 minute, the voting round will last for 1 minute.

If the timer runs out before the word is guessed, everyone loses.


## Discussion Begins

Everyone discusses who they think the **Insider** is. Discussion ends when everyone is finished, or when the hourglass runs out.

## Voting Begins

### First Vote: Judge the Guesser

Everyone, except the guesser, tries to decide if the **Guesser** is the **Insider**.

- A majority is required to accuse, a tie is not sufficient to accuse.
- If accused, the **Guesser** reveals their card/role.
    - If they incorrectly accuse the **Guesser**, the **Insider** wins and the game is over.
    - If they correctly accuse, the **Master** and **Commons** win and the game is over.
- If the vote does not accuse the **Guesser**, and the **Guesser** was not the **Insider** it moves to the second vote.

|Is the Guesser the Insider? |Yes |No |
|:---|:--:|:--:|
|Majority says yes|Commons Win|Insider Wins|
|Majority says no|Insider Wins|Go to Vote #2|

### Second Vote: Find the Insider

If the majority correctly does not think the **Guesser** is the **Insider**, the **Master** counts to 3 and everyone simultaneously points to who they think it is.

- The person with the most votes is accused as the **Insider** (majority not required).
- The **Guesser** decides a tie.
- If the **Insider** is found, the **Master** wins along with the **Commons**.
- If the **Insider** is not found (another player is chosen), the **Insider** wins.

## Setup Tips

- Word cards can be chosen from other games like Apples to Apples or Codenames.
- As a variant, or if word cards are not available, words can also be written down freely by the Master.
- Role cards can be from a standard deck of cards (Ace for Insider, King for Master, numbers for commons, etc)

> **Nathan's Notes:** This is a great scaling group game that requires almost no materials.
