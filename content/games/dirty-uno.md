Dirty Uno plays just like Uno with the addition of 3 rules:

## 1. Draw 2 and Draw 4's stack

If someone plays a Draw 2 or a Wild Draw 4, a player can lay down the same card and the next player can either continue to stack

Example: Player 1 plays a blue Draw 2. Player 2 plays a yellow Draw 2, stacking it from 2 to 4, and Player 2's turn ends. Player 3 plays a red Draw 2, stacking it from 4 to 6, and Player 3's turn ends. Player 4 has no Draw 2 cards, so must now draw the stacked total of all the Draw 2 cards, which is now 6 cards.

## 2. Exact matches can be played out of turn

If a player has an exact match of a card that was played, they can immediately play it out of turn. This skips any player in between the first card and the matched card and play resumes on the matched card's direction of play.


## 3. 0's cause all players to swap hands.

Playing a '0' causes everyone to pass their hand in direction of play.
